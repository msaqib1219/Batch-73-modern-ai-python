  ## Mandatory Pre-Class Task: GitHub Account Setup
All students must create a GitHub account before the next class. Follow these steps:



- Go to **[GitHub.com](https://github.com)** and click **"Sign up."**

- Use your a personal email.

- Choose a professional username (e.g., FirstNameLastName or FirstName_Dev).
- Check your inbox for a verification email from GitHub and confirm your account.



## Why?

GitHub is essential for collaborating on code, submitting assignments, and building a developer portfolio.

Weâ€™ll use it actively in upcoming lessons for version control and project submissions.
